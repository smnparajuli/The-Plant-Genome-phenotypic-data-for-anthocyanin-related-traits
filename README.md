Project: This project investigates the genetic architecture of anthocyanin pigment traits and purple spot (caused by Stemphyllium vesicarium) in an F1 pseudo-testcross population of asparagus (Asparagus officinalis). This project aims to understand the genetic basis of anthocyanin pigment traits and purple spot resistance. The study involves collecting phenotypic data from the field, including measurements of anthocyanin pigments in scale leaves and purple spot lesions and assessing purple spot in spear and fern. Genotypic data were obtained through genotyping by sequencing (GBS). Phenotypic data were collected from the field and statistically adjusted for the environmental variability. 
Data Files
raw_phenotypic_data.csv: This file includes raw measurements of anthocyanin pigments, purple spot resistance across different genotypes, and control samples in the field.
adjusted_data.csv: This file contains phenotypic data that has been adjusted for field variability.
