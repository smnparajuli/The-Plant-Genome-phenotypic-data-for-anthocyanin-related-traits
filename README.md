This project investigates the genetic architecture of anthocyanin pigment traits and resistance to purple spot (caused by Stemphyllium vesicarium) in an F1 pseudo-testcross population of asparagus (Asparagus officinalis). The study involves phenotypic data collection, genotypic analysis, and statistical adjustments to understand the inheritance patterns and identify potential resistance loci.
