Project: The study was conducted to understand the genetic basis of anthocyanin pigment expression and purple spot severity in asparagus, and to develop a reliable detached spear assay that correlates with field resistance to the disease. Anthocyanin pigments in the scale leaves and at the sites of infection were assessed using two methods. First, a nominal scale was used for phenotyping purple and red anthocyanin pigment in the scale leaf and sites of infection. Second, a 1 to 9 ordinal scale was employed to quantify ASL and APS .The NPS on individual spears was counted in response to natural purple spot infection. Data for all traits were collected on two spears per genotype (20Â±5 cm in length), once weekly for three weeks in early May over two consecutive years, 2021 and 2022, for the segregating pseudo-testcross population and controls. Plants were rated for anthocyanin pigment by three individuals, and the average of three ratings was computed to minimize the potential bias or error from a single rater. Spears of each genotype were also photographed in the field under natural light. The visually scored pigment data for all the genotypes were validated using digital image review. PSF was evaluated in the last week of September and the first week of October in both 2021 and 2022, allowing for maximum disease development under natural conditions. Disease severity in ferns was scored using an ordinal scale
